Solutions to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) problems in multiple languages. [Book](https://github.com/paulhirschi/dailyCodingProblem/tree/master/book/) contains solutions to problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1793296634/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_JTTOEbDZV6EWC) the book. Other solutions are from the Daily Coding Problem email subscription.

Languages so far:
* Scala
* CLisp
* Python
* JavaScript

Languages I hope to use soon:
* Haskell
* Rust

I try to solve each problem primarily in a Functional style, favoring immutability and recursion. I then try to find good solutions imperatively using iteration and mutable state.

I don't suppose my solutions to be the best solutions, and am primarily eager to find new and better ways to think about problems.

If you happen upon this and feel generous enough to share wisdom, I'm happy to accept PRs for specific solutions. I just ask that you include as your PR a separate file in a format similar to *solution-(yourName).(scala)(lisp)(py)(whatever)* . Please include plenty of comments describing your thought processes.
